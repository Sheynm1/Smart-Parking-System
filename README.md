# Smart-Parking-System
This project presented the design, development, and testing of a prototype Smart Parking IoT system using an Arduino R4 Wi-Fi board, an ultrasonic sensor, and the MQTT protocol for real-time parking space monitoring. With urban areas facing increasing vehicle congestion and limited parking availability, the goal of the project was to explore a low-cost, scalable solution capable of detecting the presence of a vehicle and communicating the parking status to users in real-time. The system was initially tested in a residential driveway using a 2014 Hyundai i20 as the test vehicle, allowing for a practical evaluation of sensor accuracy, MQTT connectivity, and real time feedback. 

Key components of the system included a 16x2 LCD for live updates and feedback, wireless communication via the ESP32-S3 chip integrated into the R4 Wi-Fi, and integration with the MQTT client, MQTT Explorer, for monitoring live data. Testing scenarios addressed the functional accuracy of vehicle detection, system latency, and response reliability. Results demonstrated accurate and consistent distance measurements, successful MQTT message publishing, and robust performance, including under battery-powered operation. 

To simulate a larger-scale deployment, generative AI was used to generate extended datasets reflecting multi-vehicle activity in a car park environment. These simulations supported the evaluation of the systemâ€™s scalability and potential applicability in real-world settings. Although the device performed effectively overall, limitations were observed about environmental exposure, power availability, and Wi-Fi coverage. Future work could include the use of extended-range or multiple sensors and the implementation of cloud-based dashboards for more comprehensive sensor data visualisation suitable for larger deployments.
